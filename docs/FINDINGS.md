# Findings

Decisions, gotchas and anything learned that is not obvious from the code.

## Bundle ID is two-segment
`com.foodmenu` has no third segment, so `flutter create --org` could not
produce it (it always appends the project name). The IDs were set by hand in
`android/app/build.gradle.kts` and `ios/Runner.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`.
Any future `flutter create` re-run over this project will reintroduce
`com.example` — re-check both files if that happens.

## Hook activation is per-clone
`core.hooksPath` lives in `.git/config`, which is not versioned. A fresh clone
has **no** attribution guard until `tool/setup_hooks.sh` is run. Worth a CI
check later if commits start arriving from other machines.

## The guard allows human co-authors
`.githooks/commit-msg` only blocks trailers naming AI tools
(claude/anthropic/copilot/gpt/openai/gemini/cursor/codex), bot addresses and
the 🤖 emoji. A normal `Co-authored-by: Name <email>` still passes, which is
intentional. Commented (`#`) lines are ignored.

## The plugin's `fmp/v1` API is a browser-only staff API
40 routes are registered under `fmp/v1`, and they cover back-office work:
inventory, purchase orders, suppliers, stock alerts, reports, order CRUD with
line items, dashboard stats. Exactly **one** is public: `GET /fmp/v1/track/{token}`
(customer order tracking).

The blocker is authentication. 34 handler sites across 10 API files begin with:

```php
$nonce = $request->get_header( 'x-wp-nonce' );
if ( ! wp_verify_nonce( $nonce, 'wp_rest' ) ) {
    return new \WP_Error( 'unauthorized', 'Authentication failed', [ 'status' => 401 ] );
}
```

A `wp_rest` nonce is derived from the logged-in **cookie session**, so no token
scheme can produce one. Verified against the running site: with a WordPress
Application Password, `GET /fmp/v1/dashboard/stats` returns 200 (it checks a
capability, not a nonce) while `GET /fmp/v1/orders` returns 401. These routes
are not reachable from a mobile client as written — they were built for the
plugin's own React dashboards, which run inside an authenticated browser.

Consequence: a staff-side app needs an auth path added on the plugin's
`mobile-app` branch — swap the nonce gate for a capability check that also
accepts Application Passwords (or a token), keeping the nonce as one accepted
credential so the existing React dashboards keep working.

## Customer-side ordering has a real headless path, via WooCommerce
The plugin exposes no customer menu/cart/checkout REST API — that flow is PHP
templates plus `admin-ajax` calls. But WooCommerce's own Store API
(`wc/store/v1`) is present and designed for headless clients:

- `GET /wc/store/v1/products` is public, no auth, and returns prices, sale
  flags and currency.
- Cart writes need two headers the API itself hands back: `Nonce` (a Store API
  nonce, returned on every response) and `Cart-Token` (a JWT identifying the
  guest cart). Verified: `POST /wc/store/v1/cart/add-item` with both headers
  added 2 × Iced Latte and returned a correct total.

So menu browsing and a guest cart work today with no plugin changes. What is
**not** covered is everything Food Menu layers on top of the cart — add-on
groups, pickup/delivery/dine-in order types with their time slots and per-branch
rules, tips, automatic discounts, branch selection. Those are cart/checkout
hooks and form fields, so they need Store API extension
(`woocommerce_store_api_register_endpoint_data`) or dedicated endpoints.

## The Pro CLAUDE.md REST table is partly stale
It documents `/qr-codes`, `/order-statuses`, `/timed-products`, `/reports`,
`/inventory-logs` and `/order-timeline` as top-level routes. On a live install
the actual paths differ — `/orders/statuses`, `/orders/{id}/timeline`,
`/reports/valuation`, `/reports/waste-cost` etc. — and `/qr-codes` and
`/timed-products` are not registered at all. Enumerate
`?rest_route=/fmp/v1` on the running site rather than trusting the table.

## Ingredients and nutrition do not exist in online-ordering mode
The plugin's "rich menu item data — ingredients, nutrition facts, food tags"
applies to its **own `food-menu` post type**, not to WooCommerce products. The
app runs against products, because that is what online ordering requires, so
two of those three fields are unreachable.

Traced on a live install:

- `food-menu-ingredient`, `food-menu-nutrition`, `food-menu-tag` and
  `food-menu-unit` are registered for **`food-menu` only**. `get_object_taxonomies('product')`
  returns none of them.
- The **Food Data** metabox that captures them is registered against
  `TLPFoodMenu()->post_type`, i.e. `food-menu`
  (`food-menu-pro/app/Controllers/Admin/Metabox/PostMeta.php`). The only
  `add_meta_box( …, 'product', … )` in either plugin is for Reviews.
- The data itself is post meta — `_ingredient` and `_nutrition`, each an array
  of `{id, unit_id, value}` referencing ingredient and unit terms
  (`FnsPro::get_fm_ingredient_list()`).
- The tabs that display them render through the plugin's own
  `fmp_single_details` action, not WooCommerce's `woocommerce_product_tabs`.
- On the dev site: 18 products, **0** carrying `_ingredient` meta, and there is
  no admin UI that could add it.

**Food tags are fine**, via a different route: WooCommerce's own `product_tag`
taxonomy, which the Store API returns as `tags` on each product. That is what
task 2.4 shipped. It is *not* the plugin's `food-menu-tag` taxonomy.

To get ingredients and nutrition into the app, one of:
1. extend the Food Data metabox and its meta to `product` on the `mobile-app`
   branch, then expose both through REST — the faithful option, and it also
   fixes the plugin's own web UI in online-ordering mode;
2. model them as WooCommerce product attributes, which the Store API already
   returns — no plugin code, but a different data model from the plugin's and
   a manual migration for anyone already using `food-menu` posts;
3. leave both out of v1.

Until one is chosen, the detail screen shows tags and no nutrition block.
